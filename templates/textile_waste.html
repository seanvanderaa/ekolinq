    <h2 class="mt24-zero-marb">Untangling Textile Waste: A Primer</h2>
    <p class="mt24-mb0">Textile waste encompasses discarded clothing, fabrics, and other textile products that are no longer used, often ending up in landfills or incinerators. Driven largely by fast fashion and overconsumption, this waste not only contributes to environmental degradation but also squanders the valuable resources embedded in every garment. In today’s economy, the sheer volume of textile waste represents a missed opportunity for reuse, recycling, and the transition toward a sustainable circular economy.</p>
    <p class="mt24">Below are three key challenges that illustrate the issue at a glance:</p>

        <h3>Landfill Overload</h3>
        <p>Discarded textiles can take decades to decompose, releasing methane—a greenhouse gas that is up to 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide (EPA, 2021).</p>

        <h3>Resource Intensity</h3>
        <p>The production of new textiles requires vast amounts of water, energy, and raw materials. For example, a single cotton shirt may require approximately 700 gallons of water (World Wildlife Fund, 2019).</p>

        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/chemicals.png') }}" aria-hidden="true" height="60">
        <h3>Chemical Impact</h3>
        <p>Toxic dyes and chemicals used during manufacturing can leach into the soil and waterways when textiles are improperly disposed of, adversely affecting ecosystems and human health (Greenpeace, 2018).</p>

          <h2>Beyond the Fabric: Unraveling the Environmental Toll</h2>
          <p>When clothing and other textiles are discarded in landfills or burned, they contribute significantly to climate change and environmental degradation. Landfills filled with textile waste generate methane as fabrics decompose—a process that intensifies global warming. Moreover, the energy-intensive production process for new textiles further exacerbates greenhouse gas emissions. The release of hazardous chemicals from textile waste not only contaminates water supplies but also disrupts local ecosystems, posing risks to both wildlife and human communities.</p>
          <p>Efforts to reuse or recycle textiles can help mitigate these impacts. By diverting clothing from landfills, recycling reduces methane emissions and the associated environmental harm. Research indicates that a systematic shift towards clothing reuse recycling could notably decrease the environmental footprint of the fashion industry, thereby aligning with broader sustainability goals (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2020).</p>

      <p class="section-title">ECONOMIC & CIRCULAR ECONOMY IMPACT</p>
      <div>
        <h2>Closing the Loop: Opportunities in a Circular Textile Economy</h2>
        <p>Textile waste represents a substantial economic loss. Every discarded garment signifies missed opportunities to either reuse or reclaim valuable fibers and materials. Transitioning from a linear “take-make-dispose” model to a circular economy not only conserves resources but also creates new revenue streams through reuse, recycling, upcycling, and resale. This shift is essential for reducing production costs and fostering innovation in sustainable materials management.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, a circular approach to textiles can stimulate local economies by creating jobs in reuse and recycling and sustainable manufacturing sectors. Businesses that embrace circularity contribute to reducing environmental liabilities while also aligning with consumer demand for responsible practices. As research from McKinsey (2021) and other industry leaders shows, a robust circular textile economy can drive significant economic and environmental benefits for communities worldwide.</p>
